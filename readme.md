# Better AIstudio

Save Time, Stay Productive

Better AI studio is a *must-have* extension for people who use Google's AI studio.

The main goal of this extension is to make AI studio better.

Instead of manually adjusting the settings, and rewriting the system instructions for *EVERY SINGLE CHAT* - you can just set up a preset inside Better AIstudio, and all that will be done *AUTOMATICALLY*, without you even having to press a single button! 

Just set it up and forget about it! 

## Settings

--> System Instructions - The instructions you want Gemini to follow. (My favorite)
--> Temperature - the creativity allowed in Gemini's responses.
--> Tools Dropdown - Quickly toggle Code Execution, Google Search grounding, and URL Context support.

## Installation

Free via the Chrome Web Store (Recommended)👇
